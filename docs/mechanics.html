    <h3>A mechanics about rewilding</h3>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
    rewild
  <h2>Main Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating: planting, printing</li>
      <li>Maintaining: ensuring Adjacency, clearing debris/detritus</li>
      <li>Modifying: adjusting rates of growth/needs/etc. for plants</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Creating</h3>
    <h3>Maintaining</h3>
    <h3>Modifying</h3>
  <h2>Adjacency</h2>
    Plants need to be near their dependencies and far from plants that are their same type but different species.<br>
    You can have lichen near other lichen but not near moss, basically.<br>
    Different plants have different needs, but all contribute the same in accordance with their type.<br>

  <h2>Plants</h2>
   For more plant information:<br>

  <h2>Time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Players have a set amount of time to accomplish what they want to do everyday, set by their suit's energy limits.</li>
      <li>At the end of each day, players are then given time to set up what they need to print before resting for the next day.</li>
      <li>Days are about 3 months apart.</li>
      <li>Later, they can upgrade their suit to allow them to spend more time outside.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Printing</h2>
  Each plant has a certain material amount that can be converted into biomats which are used to print tools.
  <h2>Tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shovel: To dig holes</li>
    <li>Sprayer: to water</li>
    <li>Sucker: to get the Essence of the plants and then spray it (may be the same as ^)</li>
